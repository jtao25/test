        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class="content" id="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project was to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website. 
                    It involved analyzing and identifying flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity 
                    and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and building a responsive website based 
                    on those prototypes.
                </p>
                <p>For this project, I decided to redesign the home page for  <a href="https://mcl.org/" style="color: #3DAF96;">Mercer County Library System</a>, 
                    the local library I grew up with. Looking back on my childhood, my local library played an 
                    integral role in my early education. I thought their website would be good to redesign because 
                    a better interface could increase community engagement with the library, and I thought this 
                    would be a good opportunity to give back to a place that shaped my formative years.

        <!-- Identifying Usability Problems -->
        <div class="content" id="part1">
            <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
                <p>Usability is a measure of how well a user can use a product or interface to accomplish a task 
                    effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily. This can be broken down into three dimensions:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><b>Learnability</b> - Is it easy for new users to learn?</li>
                    <li><b>Memorability</b> - Is it easy for casual users to recall what to do?</li>
                    <li><b>Efficiency</b> - Can frequent users accomplish typical tasks quickly?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The most usable interfaces answer yes to these questions. I began this process by performing a
                    quick walkthrough of the existing web page, jotting down any thoughts, concerns, or questions I
                    had as they arose.
                </p>
                <br>
                   <img class="full-width" src="./test/cognitive-walkthru.png" alt="cognitive-walkthrough-of-old-site">  
                <p>At a glance, the webpage was cluttered and unpolished, and I found it 
                    difficult to find and perform specific actions on the page. I then dove into a detailed analysis of 
                    the website’s usability, keeping in mind the three dimensions as well as the conceptual models 
                    that the interface uses and how they compare to the typical user’s mental models. I synthesized 
                    my findings into a few key problems:
                </p>
                   <div class="container" style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">
                        <p><b>Visual clutter and information overload</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Users may be overwhelmed by the large amount of information on the page, 
                                particularly the Resources and Services sections which have many categories
                            </li>
                            <li>This can lead to decision paralysis and make it easier to get lost
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 0px 20px;">
                        <p><b>Lack of contextual information</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Resources, Services, and Catalog sections lay out all of the options available to 
                                the user without providing any context as to what they are about or how to start using them
                            </li>
                            <li>This can be unwelcoming to new users and makes it harder to recall how to do a task
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="container" style="display: flex;">
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 30px 20px;">
                        <p><b>Unorganized information architecture/content strategy</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Resources, Services, and Catalog sections lay out all of the options available to 
                                the user without providing any context as to what they are about or how to start using them
                            </li>
                            <li>This can be unwelcoming to new users and makes it harder to recall how to do a task
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 50%; padding: 0px 20px 30px 20px;">
                        <p><b>Navigational inefficiency</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Many of the typical tasks one would perform, such as searching the library catalog, 
                                registering and looking for information about events, reserving and renewing books, and 
                                applying for a library card are hard to find or complete quickly
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                <!-- Accessibility -->
                <div>
                    <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
                    <p>After identifying usability problems, I also used WebAIM WAVE to detect issues 
                        with accessibility. These were the most significant issues it found:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> 
                                <b>Many images have null or empty alternative text.</b> 
                                I agree that this could be an issue, as alt text makes 
                                it easier for those using a screen reader to navigate the site.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li> 
                                <b>Many very low contrast errors.</b> 
                                I would disagree here. From my own observations, I didn’t notice too many 
                                apparent contrast errors, except for the hover states of the digital collection 
                                titles in the catalog section. Also, it seems like the contrast errors they found 
                                did not compare the correct foreground and background colors, creating errors that 
                                didn’t exist.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li> 
                                <b>ARIA Hidden tags.</b> 
                                Content with these tags were hidden with ARIA and not presented to screen reader users. 
                                I noticed that these tags generally only applied to the social media buttons, so users 
                                with screen readers might not be able to interact with or navigate to the library’s 
                                social media channels. However, I don’t think this is a huge area of concern.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li> 
                                <b>Redundant text titles and noscript elements.</b> 
                                WAVE recommended either removing or modifying the title attribute to provide advisory, 
                                not redundant information. This doesn’t seem too concerning in terms of accessibility. 
                                The noscript elements might not be accessible to users that have disabled scripts, but 
                                since most people do have them enabled, I don’t think this presents a huge accessibility 
                                issue either.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                </div>
                
        </div>

                <h3>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h3>
                    <p>To address these issues, I started by brainstorming solutions and sketching out low-fidelity
                        wireframes to let me ideate quickly and freely. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Highlights of my Redesign</b></p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>Reduced redundancies and clutter</li>
                        <li>Improved content strategy by putting most relevant and desired information at the top</li>
                        <li>Made typical tasks and other actions easier to locate and accomplish</li>
                        <li>Updated visual identity to be more modern and attractive</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img src="./test/Tablet%20+%20Mobile%20Lo-fi.png" alt="desktop-lofi-wireframes-markup">

                <h3>VISUAL DESIGN STYLE GUIDE</h3>
                    <p>I then created a visual design style guide that documents the main colors, typography, and reusable 
                        components’ different states in order to establish a consistent visual identity and facilitate 
                        dev handoff.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./test/Visual%20Design%20Style%20Guide.png" alt="visual-design-style-guide">

                <h3>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES</h3>
                <p>Next, I translated my low-fidelity wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes in Figma using the colors, 
                    typography, and components from my visual design style guide.
                </p>

                <h3>RESPONSIVE REDESIGN</h3>
                <p>Finally, I recreated my high-fidelity prototypes using HTML and CSS to build Mercer County Library’s 
                    redesigned and responsive home page. Note that I used dummy elements for certain navigational elements 
                    and buttons.
